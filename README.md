# Matlab_Introduction
A few exercises to begin with Matlab

## Getting started

To begin with Matlab, you need... Matlab! Unfortunately Matlab is not a free software but you can get it for a reasonable price through the Student License. The License gives you access to updates for a year and after that time you can still use the software but without regular updates. I understand Loulou!! MEUHHHHHHHHHHHHH

### Working with Github
