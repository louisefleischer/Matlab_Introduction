# Matlab_Introduction
A few exercises to begin with Matlab

## Getting started

To begin with Matlab, you need... Matlab! Unfortunately Matlab is not a free software but you can get it for a reasonable price through the Student License. The License gives you access to updates for a year and after that time you can still use the software but without regular updates. I understand Loulou!! MEUHHHHHHHHHHHHH

### Working with Github
A useful tool to share code scripts is to create a Github repository between the members of your team. The first exercise can be found under the “1_Getting_Git_and_Github” file of this repository.

## Introduction

### At first there was nothing

Whenever starting with a new program language, it is important to get familiar with the working environment. Now that you have installed Matlab, open the software and take a look at the different subwindows you can see. Note that every window is modular and can be opened outside of the main display. I personnaly like having everything in the same page but when codes get long, it is nice to display the whole editor in a separate window.

-- Editor? But what is that?

The editor is to the command window what your notepad is to your terminal. You can write and save multiple lines of code in the editor but it will be through the command window that the actual computation is going to happen. The nice thing is that Matlab's editor is able to proof read your code before you run it, this way you can correct typos and small mistakes before putting any computation power into the code. 

### First steps

Now is time to crack your fingers because we are going to dive straight into our first exercise. We are going to make a script that will display "Hello Cow World!" in the command window. The exercise can be found under 2_Hello_Cow_World.md

## Variables

### One Meuh, Two Meuh, True Meuhs

Let's play a little with types and variables. Matlab handles words and numbers differently. Logicals (true or false) are used for to assess statements. In as short as possible, this is how you should think of the three main classes of Matlab:

double: numbers
char: words
logical: true or false

There are different functions that handle each type of classes and this chapter's exercise will let you play with some of them.

### Storing multiple variables

You can put multiple variables in one place through the following elements:

arrays: matrices
cell: can contain variables of different types
structures: allows to match fields with values

The exercise is accessible under the file two_meuhs.m
