# 2_Hello_Cow_World

## At first there was nothing

Whenever starting with a new program language, it is important to get familiar with the working environment. Now that you have installed Matlab, open the software and take a look at the different subwindows you can see. Note that every window is modular and can be opened outside of the main display. I personnaly like having everything in the same page but when codes get long, it is nice to display the whole editor in a separate window.

-- Editor? But what is that?

The editor is to the command window what your notepad is to your terminal. You can write and save multiple lines of code in the editor but it will be through the command window that the actual computation is going to happen. The nice thing is that Matlab's editor is able to proof read your code before you run it, this way you can correct typos and small mistakes before putting any computation power into the code. 

## First steps

Now is time to crack your fingers because we are going to dive straight into our first exercise. We are going to make a script that will display "Hello Cow World!" in the command window.

From the tab `Home`, cick on create a new script. Save it as hello_script in your Matlab Introduction repository.
Without typing anything, click on "run" in the editor tab (or F5 as a shortcut). When the window pops up , click "change folder". This is telling Matlab which directory it should be working from. For you it is Matlab_introduction.

Now that you have run this function, you should see in the Command window (bottom) a two chevrons with the name of your function. Matlab has successfully compiled your code, but as it was empty, it only displayed the title of your file.

Now type with the quotes and the semi-colon: `disp('Hello Cow World!');` What do you see?
Try without quotes and/or without disp() and/or without semi-colon and observe what the command window outputs. Now add a `%` in front of the line and run it again. The line has changed colors, it is now a comment and won't be read by Matlab. 

Your exercise is to save in this hell_script file a list of all function ways of displaying `'Hello Cow World!` on the command window. Comment each line with an explanation of what makes that command line different than the others. 

## And then came cows, 'cows' and true cows

That is for next lesson!
