# 1_Getting_Git_and_Github

## Exercise

Coding is very fun and creative but it can also be quickly recursive and repetitive. This is why it is important to write down the shortcuts that you fall upon as you are discovering them. Some mechs have more memories than others, but all of them will eventually forget the longest commands. It is also nice to write the out-of-code steps that you are taking when installing a new program. This can save you time if your machine crashes in the future (we hope not) or if you want to share these steps with someone else (we hope).

As part of your first exercise, you will fill up the two following paragraphs with everything that you learnt yesterday and that you think could be useful in the future. You will then push this file to Github (with a properly labelled commit). See you soon on the Grassland of Github!
