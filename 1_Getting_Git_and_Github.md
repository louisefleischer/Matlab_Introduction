# 1_Getting_Git_and_Github

## Exercise

Coding is very fun and creative but it can also be quickly recursive and repetitive. This is why it is important to write down the shortcuts that you fall upon as you are discovering them. Some mechs (MECHS?) have more memories than others, but all of them will eventually forget the longest commands. It is also nice to write the out-of-code steps that you are taking when installing a new program. This can save you time if your machine crashes in the future (we hope not) or if you want to share these steps with someone else (we hope).

As part of your first exercise, you will fill up the two following paragraphs with everything that you learnt yesterday and that you think could be useful in the future. You will then push this file to Github (with a properly labelled commit). See you soon on the Grassland of Github!

# Beginning with Github and Git

I am very happy to be able to oblige my wonderful teacher by detailing a few of the key points we visited yesterday here in this exercise :)

According to LAEWF, github is one of the more excellent inventions there has been. It is an immensely powerful tool for collaboration in the world of computer coding. Across languages and disciplines, github provides a platform to share, explore, and develop code between members of the public and private users, collaborating both directly and indirectly. Git hosts (for our purposes) public repositories where a project can take shape and be ferried in versions between our computers. We’re going to use Github to learn Matlab, and utilize it in great part through the Mac terminal. 

Git is a Version Control System, which essentially allows coders to track changes to segments of code they are working on. This is quite useful in the development of code for one’s own reference, and practically invaluable in the context of code being created by multiple users independently (whether sequentially or simultaneously). Coding is a pursuit which requires discipline, logical rigor, and precision in combination with creativity, and the ability to review the iterative development of a piece of code makes the processes of learning from it, further developing it, or utilizing it far easier and more productive activities. (SEE BOTTOM FOR IMPORTANT GIT PROTOCOLS, WHICH WERE MAINLY LEFT IN THE TERMINAL SECTION ANYWAYS)

# Useful shortcuts for the terminal

cd goes in to whatever you specify 

starting out a word after cd and then hitting “tab” will automatically complete that word

cd .. goes back one level inside the hierarchical organization of the computer

cd ~ goes back all the way to the top tier of the terminal 

ls displays whatever is in the currently accessed hierarchy (which is quite useful for using the “tab” shortcut given that all the relevant options are displayed)

then there are some git specific things like git pull (for importing exotic products of the instructive pasture), git push and git add which I am not so sure about mechanically, but which I think respectively push changes to the file on the repository and add the changes to the file locally while confirming the changes. 

Also escape takes you out of some situations

Also :q! gets you out of a command? 

Anyways, that’s all I can remember for now, and I have a date to call someone so I will be signing off. To the grasslands! (Orangemoji)

P.S. SO! the process for pushing the things back to the RGV (RenneuhGitVacheuh) is as follows. 

-make your changes in the local code
-save your changes in the local code
-write git add <name of local file changed> 
-write git status to verify that changes have been made (running this before the add step will yield the identity of changed files in red that have not been added) 
-write git commit -m “[name of edits for reference]”
-write git push to send to LouLou! (or other less interesting people)
